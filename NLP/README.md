# Natural Language Processing(NLP) on Azure

Natural language processing (NLP) is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.

NLP enables you to create software that can:

- Analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources.
- Interpret spoken language, and synthesize speech responses.
- Automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages.
- Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions.

For example, Starship Commander, is a virtual reality (VR) game from Human Interact, that takes place in a science fiction world. The game uses natural language processing to enable players to control the narrative and interact with in-game characters and starship systems.

In Microsoft Azure, you can use the following cognitive services to build natural language processing solutions:

## NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SERVICES

**Text Analytics** -	Use this service to analyze text documents and extract key phrases, detect entities (such as places, dates, and people), and evaluate sentiment (how positive or negative a document is).

**Translator Text** -	Use this service to translate text between more than 60 languages.

**Speech** -	Use this service to recognize and synthesize speech, and to translate spoken languages.

**Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)** -	Use this service to train a language model that can understand spoken or text-based commands.

## Try Examples
To see an example of a how you can use natural language to interact with an AI system, follow these steps:

- Open a browser and go to https://aidemos.microsoft.com/luis/demo.
- Use the demo interface to control the lighting in the virtual home. You can type instructions, use the microphone button to speak commands, or select any of the suggested phrases to see how the system responds.
