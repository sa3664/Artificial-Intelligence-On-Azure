# Machine Learning on Azure

Data scientists can use all of that data to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.

Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning service - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning provides the following features and capabilities:

**Automated machine learning** -	This feature enables non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model from data.

**Azure Machine Learning designer** -	A graphical interface enabling no-code development of machine learning solutions.

**Data and compute management** -	Cloud-based data storage and compute resources that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.

**Pipelines** -	Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks.
