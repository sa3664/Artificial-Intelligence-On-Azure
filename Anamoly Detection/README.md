# Anamoly Detection on Azure

Imagine you're creating a software system to monitor credit card transactions. 

- You detect an unusual usage patterns that might indicate fraud.
- or an application that tracks activity in an automated production line and identifies failures.
- or a racing car telemetry system that uses sensors to proactively warn engineers about potential mechanical failures before they happen.

These kinds of scenario can be addressed by using anomaly detection - a machine learning based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes.

In Microsoft Azure, the Anomaly Detector service provides an application programming interface (API) that developers can use to create anomaly detection solutions
