# Conversational AI on Azure

Conversational AI is the term used to describe solutions where AI agents participate in conversations with humans. Most commonly, conversational AI solutions use bots to manage dialogs with users. These dialogs can take place through web site interfaces, email, social media platforms, messaging systems, phone calls, and other channels.

Bots can be the basis of AI solutions for:

-  Customer support for products or services.
- Reservation systems for restaurants, airlines, cinemas, and other appointment based businesses.
- Health care consultations and self-diagnosis.
- Home automation and personal digital assistants.
