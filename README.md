## What is AI ?

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key elements include:

**Machine learning** - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.

**Anomaly detection** - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.

**Computer vision** - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.

**Natural language processing** - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.

**Conversational AI** - The capability of a software "agent" to participate in a conversation.
