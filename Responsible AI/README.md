# Responsible AI on Azure

Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that can be used to greatly benefit the world. However, like any tool, it must be used responsibly.

At Microsoft, AI software development is guided by a set of six principles, designed to ensure that AI applications provide amazing solutions to difficult problems without any unintended negative consequences.

### **Fairness**
AI systems should treat all people fairly. For example, suppose you create a machine learning model to support a loan approval application for a bank. The model should make predictions of whether or not the loan should be approved without incorporating any bias based on gender, ethnicity, or other factors that might result in an unfair advantage or disadvantage to specific groups of applicants.

Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction. This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model.

### **Reliability and safety**
AI systems should perform reliably and safely. For example, consider an AI-based software system for an autonomous vehicle; or a machine learning model that diagnoses patient symptoms and recommends prescriptions. Unreliability in these kinds of system can result in substantial risk to human life.

AI-based software application development must be subjected to rigorous testing and deployment management processes to ensure that they work as expected before release.

### **Privacy and security**
AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data, which may contain personal details that must be kept private. Even after the models are trained and the system is in production, it uses new data to make predictions or take action that may be subject to privacy or security concerns.

### **Inclusiveness**
AI systems should empower everyone and engage people. AI should bring benefits to all parts of society, regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or other factors.

### **Transparency**
AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

### **Accountability**
People should be accountable for AI systems. Designers and developers of AI-based solution should work within a framework of governance and organizational principles that ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

The principles of responsible AI can help you understand some of the challenges facing developers as they try to create ethical AI solutions. It's easy to read about the principles, or watch a video; but it's much harder to put the principles into practice.

## Try Examples
Here's an activity to help you learn more about how principles apply to an AI system that interacts with human users.

- Open a browser and go to https://aidemos.microsoft.com/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/demo.
- Select cards from each of the decks, which represent four phases in a Human-AI interaction:
  - Initially
  - During the interaction
  - When something goes wrong
  - Over time

- For each card, view the examples provided.
- Try to identify which of the six principles the examples reflect (an example might reflect more than one principle).
